Linear Regression Project: Boston House Price Prediction
-------------------------------
**Objective**

The problem at hand is to predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, we need to identify the most important features affecting the price of the house. We will employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for the unseen data.

**Dataset**
Each record in the database describes a house in Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The data and prompts for the exercise was provided by MIT Applied Data Science Program.

*Attribute Information:*

- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric Oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: The average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 dollars
